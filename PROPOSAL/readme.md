# PHASE 1 - PROPOSAL (MOVIE RECOMMENDATION SYSTEM)
Synopsis & General Idea

A movie recommendation system is a type of information filtering system which attempts to predict the preferences of a user. By analysing users behaviour such as ratings, movie recommendation system aims to offer personalized recommendations that align with individual tastes and interests. It employs algorithms to match users with films that they are likely to enjoy in order to enhancing their overall viewing experience.

Furthermore, this system is able to collect information about users’ choices and can use this information to improve their suggestions in the future. For example, it may track which movies users watch, how they rate them, and which recommendations they follow. These are allowing the system to give more suggestions accurately to each user. Sometimes, the recommendation systems can make improvements based on the activities of a large number of people too. For example, if the system observes a large number of customers who watch the latest movie, they can recommend the movie to a new user who has just download the movie recommendation system.

Three main approaches are used for our recommender systems which is demographic filtering, content-based filtering and collaborative filtering. For demographic filtering, they offer generalized recommendations to every user based on movie popularity and genre. The basic concept is movies that are more popular will have a higher probability of being liked by the average audience. Next, content-based filtering involves profiling users’ interests using information collected and recommend items based on that profile. The other is collaborative filtering aim to group similar users together and use information about the group to make recommendations to the user.
